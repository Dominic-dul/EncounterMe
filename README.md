## Delegates.
## Events and their usage: standard and custom.
## Exceptions and dealing with them in a meaningfull way.

## Concurrent programming (threading or async/await (for your own written classes); common resource usage between threads).
## Web service implemented and used
## Dependency Injection.

## Select/insert/update/delete usage.
## LINQ usage: Join, Group, Skip and Take, Agregate function.
## Entity Framework usage.
## Usage of middleware and at least one interceptor
